# Final project

# Subject

Clinic appointments and treatment administration system.

[Documentation](https://github.com/OleksandrBieliakov/mas/blob/main/clinic/Documentation.pdf)

# User requirements

The system should allow the clinic staff to book appointments for patients’ examinations and procedures. A staff user first must be able to check the available timeslots for a required type of appointment and then to select a timeslot suitable for a patient. The appointment may include assigning doctors and/or nurses, room, required medicine and equipment for procedures.

Patients should be able to enter the system using their patient accounts to check details about their appointments or cancel their appointments. Patients should also be able to check their treatments details and history.

Doctors and Nurses should also be able to check appointments details, book, cancel or create new appointments, access patients’ treatment details and history.

Doctors should be able to assign patients treatment.

It should also be possible to evaluate an appointment cost based on involved staff rates, used medicine and equipment.
